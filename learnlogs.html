in the box model, margins collapse 
(margins do not add together for two elements that are together. Also,
height is decided by your determined height + your padding*2 and your border*2.
You can change this by using box-sizing and set that to border-box.

    If you just input numbers into a <code>margin</code> property, 
    it will use spaces as separators and take them in this following order:
    <code> margin-top,</code> <code>margin-right,</code> <code>margin-bottom,</code> <code>margin-left,</code>

<p class="notes">

    If using <code>auto</code> for margins, it will only work if you have predetermined 
    the width, and it only works horozonitally. 
    (otherwise it will usually default to 0 or utilize whatever space is on it's side.)

    Even if you have a nested margin set 
    (for example the p has a higher margin than the div
    in which it is contained in)
    It will still use the highest one.
